# ArenaQuickJoin

Adds a convenient button that makes joining Arena/RBG matches hassle-free.

## Overview:

This tiny addon tackles a frequent problem associated with macros similar to this `/click ConquestJoinButton`, preventing inadvertent entry into the Solo Shuffle queue or any other rated option available by making sure the correct arena option is selected according to group size. It streamlines the Arena/RBG match joining process, thereby improving the overall gaming experience.

**Please note that the button only appears when you're at maximum level.**

## Features:

- **Draggable Button:** Easily move the button around by holding the Shift modifier.
- **Quick Access:** Open the "Rated" arena frame by holding the Control modifier and the "Quick Match" frame by holding the Alt modifier.
- **Combat and Instances:** The button grays out during combat and remains hidden inside instances.
  
## Known Issue:
When you open the group finder while in combat and try to select one of the rated brackets it wouldn't get tracked by the addon due to in-combat restrictions and how the secure environment works so in short it's a Blizzard thing.
